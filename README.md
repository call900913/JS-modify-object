# Elba the Palindrome Detector 
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/elba-palindrome-detector.png?compact=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/elba-palindrome-detector)

Originally, I began writing this module only to practice Vim. However, after a few days, I decided to publish it to NPM: 
[https://www.npmjs.com/package/elba-palindrome-detector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elba-palindrome-detector)

Here I added the palindrome method to the JS String object so that you can call it like so:

```
>"racecar".palindrome()
>true
```

When the string contains punctuations, the palindrome() method will look only at the letters.

## Tests
Before running tests, ensure you have Mocha in your system:
```
npm install --global mocha
```

## Installing

1. Ensure you have Node on your machine by typing in the Terminal: `which node`
If you don't have Node installed, go here: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

2. When you have Node, type this into the Terminal:
```
npm install elba-palindrome-detector
```
