# LISEZMOI

Part of my Vim practice. I added the palindrome method to the JS String object so that you can call it like so:

```
>"racecar".palindrome()
>true
```

As of this writing, the function is limited to strings without punctuations.

## Folders and Tests
The .js files that are inside folders have mocha tests. 

Befpre running those tests, run the following in your Terminal: 
```
npm install --global mocha
```
